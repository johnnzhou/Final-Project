"NOTE: Data are for postsecondary institutions participating in Title IV federal financial aid programs. Race categories exclude persons of Hispanic ethnicity. Reported racial/ethnic distributions of students by level of degree, field of degree, and sex were used to estimate race/ethnicity for students whose race/ethnicity was not reported. To facilitate trend comparisons, certain aggregations have been made of the degree fields as reported in the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS): ""Agriculture and natural resources"" includes Agriculture, agriculture operations, and related sciences and Natural resources and conservation; and ""Business"" includes Business management, marketing, and related support services and Personal and culinary services. Some data have been revised from previously published figures.      ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
