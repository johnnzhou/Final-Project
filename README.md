# Final Project Proposal


### Project Description
### Technical Analysis
> This section of your proposal is an opportunity to think through the specific analytical steps you'll need to complete throughout the project.

How will you be reading in your data (i.e., are you using an API, or is it a static .csv/.json file)? 
What types of data-wrangling (reshaping, reformatting, etc.) will you need to do to your data?
What (major/new) libraries will be using in this project (no need to list common libraries that are used in many projects such as dplyr)
What major challenges do you anticipate? 
Not required, but optional: what questions, if any, will you be answering with statistical analysis/machine learning?
