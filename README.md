# Final-Project Proposal


### Project Description
My group will use the dataset about education in America starting from prekindergarten through graduate school. Institute of Education Sciences gathered these statistics through surveys across 
United States. The website of National Center for Education Statistics allowed me to gain access 
for the data. Lastly, this database includes education information from 1995 to current year.

Our  target audience are minorities who feel discriminated due to their race or gender. They believe that there is still inequality in the work place.  With the data  that our team analyzes, this can prove to our audience that there still is a discrimination in the workplace due to race or gender. 


### Technical Analysis
> This section of your proposal is an opportunity to think through the specific analytical steps you'll need to complete throughout the project.

How will you be reading in your data (i.e., are you using an API, or is it a static .csv/.json file)? 
What types of data-wrangling (reshaping, reformatting, etc.) will you need to do to your data?
What (major/new) libraries will be using in this project (no need to list common libraries that are used in many projects such as dplyr)
What major challenges do you anticipate? 
Not required, but optional: what questions, if any, will you be answering with statistical analysis/machine learning?
