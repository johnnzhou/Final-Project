# Project Description
My group will use the dataset about education in America starting from prekindergarten through graduate school. Institute of Education Sciences gathered these statistics through surveys across 
United States. The website of National Center for Education Statistics allowed me to gain access 
for the data. Lastly, this database includes education information from 1995 to current year.
